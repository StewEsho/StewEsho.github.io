Proof-of-concept desktop client that manages city transit systems and the trips taken on them. Designed and developed using Java with JavaFX in a group of 4 as part of a Software Design course at the University of Toronto. 

Clients can create pre-paid transit cards that they can use to take trips between stations, while admin users can track rider statistics.
